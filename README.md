This is a code to generate one out of six different graphs using a simple GUI created with Tkinter.
This code uses Pandas to retrieve information from a csv file and then uses Matplotlib to plot this information into a graph which you can download.
You can use this repository to understand a few things about how Pandas and Matplotlib work.
